WARMUP

Create a component that renders another component. That component should render... ANOTHER COMPONENT.
Each component should include a `div` with CSS styling - component 1 should be 500 x 500 px and have a red solid border, component 2 should be 400 x 400 and have a blue dashed border, and component 3 should be 300 x 300 and have a green dotted border.
