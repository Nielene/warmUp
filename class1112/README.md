WARM UP! Reed:
You have an array of objects representing comments. Each object has an id (int) and a comment body (string). Create a function that accepts the array and a string representing a banned word. Remove all comment objects from the array containing the banned word and return the array.

For example: with the array `[{id: 1, comment: "This is bad"}, {id: 2, comment: "This is good"}]` and the string `bad`, you should remove the first index and return an array with only the object at index 1.
