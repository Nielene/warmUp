@channel WARM UP! Create an ES6 class, `ConfusedCalc`, that has four functions - `add`, `subtract`, `multiply` and `divide`. Each of these take two arguments and do what you'd expect.

It also has a *fifth* function, called `shuffle`, that accepts two arguments and does *one of the previously named functions* at random.
