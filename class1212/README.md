for the consecutive numbers problem, don't worry about making them consecutive, that's a little more than we want at this point.


//Reed:

sql not case or indentation sensitive.
no. of times something appears: count.
_sum_: the total: when our column contains numbers. ; the sum of all the relevant numerical values if our table contains them.
_count_: the number of times; the count of rows that fulfil that conditions.


cant sum the "Johns"
but can COUNT the no. of them.

sum and count are - aggragate funcitons.
syntheises data into a table into something that might not exist in our table but tells us something about that table.

use group by instead of where. to use COUNT.
