write a function that takes in a string number and an ending number. it should output the sum of all the numbers in between (including those numbers).

sum(5, 10) // => 45;


5,6,7,8,9,10

5+10m= 15
6+9=15
7+8=15

constant * ...(number of nos./2)?
=15 * 6/2
=15 * (3)
=45

//2.-----------

write a funciton that takes in an array and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array. your implementation should include forEach.

//3. ----------

(map returns an array)

write a funciton that takes in a n array and a number. the output should be an array with every number multiplied by the given number. your implementation should include the method map.

somethingIt([1,2,3], 4) // => [2,8,12]
