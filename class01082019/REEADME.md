@channel warm up!! Create a function, `find` that accepts a stack and another value as arguments. It should return null if the stack does not include the value, and the value itself if it does.
- little clarification note - the stack should be the same at the end. In other words, anything that you pop off should go right back on!

just to confirm: we need to build a stack structure first?
iow donâ€™t just use a regular array and do something like:
arr.includes(target)
?

assume you have a stack class
with the functions push pop and peek

Rinat [10:15 AM]
so the function accepts an instance of a stack?

reed [10:19 AM]
yep!
