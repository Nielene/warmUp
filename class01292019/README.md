@channel WARM UP! Write a function, `findMiddle`, that accepts a Linked List's head node as an argument, passes through the list *once*, and returns the value in the middle node. If the Linked List is even in length, it should return the value in the first of the two middle nodes. In other words, in a list of length 4, it should return the value of the second node.
