@channel WARM UP! Use the pokemon api. Create an app that has a form that takes in a name of a pokemon. When someone enters the name of the pokemon display the info for that pokemon below. Choose the info youâ€™d like to display.

3 Things

//=================

create-react-app pokemon_search

components:
app
form - can be functional. with state can then submit it to app.js
display pokemon_search(routing optional)


npm install axios --save  (tests will be to see if they compile - should be stuck in dependencies) - lose -1 points if have to debug.
