@channel WARM UP! Copy and paste the movie data from our ghibli api and store it in a Movie componenet. Once a button is clicked, the movies should be displayed inside a <ul> with their title, description, and release date (or whatever, be creative). Each of these movie <li>â€™s should be passed into a function component that is setting up the display of information :slightly_smiling_face:.
