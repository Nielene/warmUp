write a function that takes a starting number and returns an array from that number down to zero.

countDown(9) // => [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]


// NEVER return inside a for loop!


//2.
Write a function that takes in a *starting* number and an *ending* number and returns *an array* of all numbers in between including the start and ending number.

range(4,9) // => [4,5,6,7,8,9]


//

write a fucniton that takes in two numbers and returns the larger number. it should be a one-line function using ternary.

larger(4,6)//=> 6

//

Write a funciton that takes in a high number and a divisor and returns all the numbers from 0 to the high number that are divisible by divisor.

divisible(20, 6)// => 6, 12,18

// ------

write this function again but this time use a while loop;

//---------

write a function that takes in number. returns an array of all number from that number down to 0 dividing by 2. write a while loop an d for loop version.

divisor(50)//=>[50, 25, 12, 6, 3, 1, 0]

  Variable reassignment:
  i ++    i += 1    i = i + 1
          i /= 2    i = i / 2
