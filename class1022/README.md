@channel WARM UP! Given an array of objects representing developers who have signed up to attend a coding meetup, write a function getAverageAge that returns the average age of developers (rounded to the nearest integer). Exp. let list1 = [
 { firstName: 'Maria', lastName: 'Y.',  age: 30, language: 'JavaScript' },
 { firstName: 'Victoria', lastName: 'T.',  age: 35, language: 'Python' },
];      getAverageAge(list1) // => 33
