WARM UP!
Create an express app that has the following routes.
*/* Should say *this is the home page*.
*/pokemon* - should give a list of all pokemon.
*/pokemon/:id* should give a specific pokemon.
Use pokemon and Ghibli api to help you make calls from your express backend.
*/movies* gives a list of movies
*/movies/:id* gives specific movie.
separate your files.

Make your axios calls in the backend.
All other routes should render a 404 NOT FOUND
This is all about express. No need to worry about front end visuals.
