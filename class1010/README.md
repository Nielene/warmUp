 WARM UP!
 String Compression.


 For each character in a string log the character and the count in a compressed format. Exp stringCompression("aaabbcca") // => "a3b2c2a1"

 For each consecutive character in a string, log the number of times that character appears in a row. So, for example, "aaa" becomes "a3" because "a" appears three times in that string.

 Your task is to write a function that takes a string as an argument and converts that string to this compressed format.
