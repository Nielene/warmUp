WARM UP! Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns whether or not the strings are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are strings that contain the same letters and count of each lettter. Example isAnagrams("elvis", "lives") //=> true



//reed:
//split string into ...
//cannot test for equality for objs and arrays

let arr1 = [1,2,3]
let arr2 = [1,2,3]

arr1 === arr2
//returns false


split "" - btw each letter

eg:
"reed"  "deer"
"eedr"  "eedr"

can make an obj and populate it with ..keys.. but objs are not easily tested for.
